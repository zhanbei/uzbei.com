A [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) consists of posts where a post is the *about* - a post describes about something and this post is about the my *personal preferences* of content management of a blog site.

Manage content of a website is not easy and considerations are needed among classification/categories, subdomains, [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink), and etc, but for a blog site, things can be a little bit informal and individual.

## Categories of Content

No category is officially introduced since posts can't be just simply classified, like entries in wikipedia are not classified.

However, sometimes, common prefixes can be found in the post titles, and to optimize the structure of posts, a folder can be used to group posts that share a same prefix but not for all prefixes, which a bit looks like a category. Among all common prefixes, when *the standalone title of a post without a prefix literally make sense*, a folder may be better created for the prefix and group some posts; some folders may be:

- `how-to`
- `my`
- `get-started-with`
- `about`

The following keywords, may *not* be used as categories:

- `topics`
- `frontend`
- `linux`
- `mongodb`
- `python`
- `what`
- `when`
- `why`

As shown above, the `how-to` can be used as a prefix but not the `what`, `when`, or `why`, because often the post title followed by `how-to` can be understood standalone.

## Tags of Content

Tags can be used to find related posts.
