Social media involves the followers(=Receivers) and their followings(=Posters). The followers can have multiple accounts to group followings, while the followings can have multiple accounts to post separated contents.

## The Differences between Organization Account and Individual Account

The organization account may be not suitable to post personal stuff. The posts are often official. Generally the individual account is suitable to post personal contents and may involve work stuff, since work is part of life, but it may be not that cool to mix work stuff and personal life together.

## Reasons Followers Follow an Account of a Person

The followers follow someone may because they:

0. are interested in what one is doing.

 Often you follow a person in order to know more about what the person does. In this way people can learn from those stuffs and therefore grow up.

0. are interested in the person oneself.

 By following the person you interested in, you can learn from the person about how to do things, how to behave, how to response something, and etc, and you will know more detail about the person, the one who does awesome things.

0. care about the person behind.

 Often you two are acquaintances or friends, and therefore somehow you care about the opposite and by following the person you care about, you know what is going on about the person.

## Reasons to Have Separated Accounts

We can create organizations for projects, companies, or products, and therefore post different posts in their corresponding domain, but still there are situations that we need to separate our individual accounts.
The facts are you may already post same, and more often different messages on different platforms, twitter and facebook for instances. You may post totally different messages in different tongues, and probably with different images, just like you are doing differently in facebook, twitter, linkedin, and other platforms.

Most often your contents posted differ with different audiences, so grouping audiences and posting single-purposed contents for corresponding groups may be a good practice.
Having multiple accounts to separate posts in by categories is one solution, and in this case, every account is a newses source for corresponding audiences.

You may want to group your audiences especially when you get a lot of stuffs to share and often it is the time when you are stepping into a specific domain, or you are proficient at something in a specific domain, like coding, design, accounting, or video editing, and most often your career is related to this domain, you are gonna learn lots of stuff and do lots of work, and you are gonna share it, in the same time, however, you do not want to bother your fans with professional feeds, since they may be not interest in, or care about what you care about.

Generally multiple accounts are used to post or subscribe separated contents related to *Individual*, *Schools*, *Interests*, *Skills*, *Career*, *Games*, *Sports*, *Society*, and *Policies*.

### Content

0. The personal account.

 Posts posted in this account should be related to the real person, most often including, what one is feeling, just experienced and has seen, and sometimes some special moments in other accounts like, a tiny part of work life, a few newses about policy, society, or whatever you interest in is included.

 This account may often be private for public since it contains very personal stuff, and usually your selfies, and sometimes some secrets. But it can be open, or partially open for public to know little about you before connect you as friends.

0. The career/working account.

 Post via this account about stuffs related to career, like daily working, or skills you are learning.

 This account is usually open for public and for those who are interested in your posts to follow and subscribe your feeds to communicate.

0. The social account.

 It may be used to post your reviews about social policies, or social newses, if you care about.

 This account may be open for public to follow and subscribe your feeds.

0. The interest account.

 As long as you are professional about something, you got a lot to share about what you have experienced and learned to help others who are interested.

 This account may be open for public to follow.

## Reasons to Group Alike Followings

While the as a subscriber, we subscribe many accounts by interests, topics, and categories of domains.

[Sina's Weibo](https://weibo.com/) allows its users to customly group followings.

0. Group by interested domains and concentrate on related feeds as needed.

 A real person interests in many domains, like travel, music, coding, photography, or policies. More often we need focus on one domain as need to avoid interruptions.

0. Group different communities together and see what is going on.

 We do have been involved in different communities as we are growing up, like different schools, colleges, family, or teams offline and online.
