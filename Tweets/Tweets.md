## [NOTE] Refuse the Interested Flyer `2018-11-xx`

<!-- > 2018-12-03T00:40:48+0800 -->

The gym nearby got promotions and flyers were distributed around for several days. One day, I was going to have my dinner and met a young fellow at the intersection distributing flyers. The bro said very interestingly: "Hello, are you interested in fitness? There is a new gym here." I kept walking and said, "Ummm ~ ~ En ~ ~,,,", until I missed the little brother about two steps before I posed out how to answer, I am very satisfied o(∩∩)o... and said: "Sure I am interested, but sorry I don't need it. Thank you (I kept hidden smiles)." The little brother also laughed and said: "What are you hesitating about?" and I stopped and left then.
