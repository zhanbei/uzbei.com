## [THINK] Is the real world fake? Idealism vs Materialism `2018-12-01`

<!-- > 2018-12-01T23:09:12+0800 -->

ABOUT: The real world -- the connected net of the virtual awarenesses of all human. (dreaming or faint can be counted as temporary offline. :)

- ME: "Hey, looking how it feels like to reach out your hands in the wind of the fast car, like waving hands in the water but the hands are totally dry."
- SY: "Agreed."
- ME: "Think about the VR/AR; I believe that human would experience lots of things and don't have to really do everything in the real world in the future, for example, to learn swimming without water."
- SY: "Hence what do you think about the real world? Is it real?"
- ME: "Aha, looks like we are gonna talk about the *Idealism* vs the *Materialism*. Let us say the idealism, it's like everyone has their own imagined *real* world or awareness that has feelings and logics. Hence the '*real world*' of the materialism is the connected awareness of all lives or even things -- that any things/plants/animals(human) may have their no/one/multi virtual awarenesses which are connected together and combined as the real world, like the Internet, which also has its meaning no matter how many Intranet exists."
- SY: "Fine."


## [NOTE] Refuse the Interested Flyer `2018-11-xx`

<!-- > 2018-12-03T00:40:48+0800 -->

The gym nearby got promotions and flyers were distributed around for several days. One day, I was going to have my dinner and met a young fellow at the intersection distributing flyers. The bro said very interestingly: "Hello, are you interested in fitness? There is a new gym here." I kept walking and said, "Ummm ~ ~ En ~ ~,,,", until I missed the little brother about two steps before I posed out how to answer, I am very satisfied o(∩∩)o... and said: "Sure I am interested, but sorry I don't need it. Thank you (I kept hidden smiles)." The little brother also laughed and said: "What are you hesitating about?" and I stopped and left then.
