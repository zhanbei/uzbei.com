Introducing [Web Assistant](https://github.com/zhanbei/Web-Assistant) -- a Chrome extension to add custom buttons to execute custom scripts.

As for sites and pages basically are not designed for every user,
occasionally, you may find something uncomfortable and can be improved when browsing web-pages.

Normally you have to be patient to draft a proposal to feed a feature/issue back to the sites owner.
However, it depends whether you can get a replay or not and when.
Time lapses and you get your problem solved in the *hard* way.

Hence some scripts(as the web world are considerably open, thankfully) may be needed as "hotfixes" to slightly alter the UI or functionalities
to meet up requirements and some use cases of ourselves better.

Kinds of extensions in webstore are kind of designed to do such tasks.
However extensions are relatively heavy,
and it may be hard to find your desired ones or the ones you expected literally do not exist.

The extension *Web Assistant* help you to achieve such a purpose.
With custom and dynamic scripts supported, you are in control of the elements and styles of the pages you are visiting.
